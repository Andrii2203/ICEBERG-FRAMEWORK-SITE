## 🌐 Overview
This repository contains the official landing website for the **Iceberg Framework** — a deterministic system of standards, protocols, and execution maps designed to control AI‑assisted development.

The website is built using **Next.js App Router**, follows strict architectural rules, and implements the Iceberg principles of determinism, structure, and reproducibility.
