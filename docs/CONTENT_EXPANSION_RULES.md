# CONTENT EXPANSION RULES
Guidelines for E-E-A-T compliant content depth.

## 1. PURPOSE
To eliminate "Thin Content" and establish the project as an authority in the Iceberg category.

## 2. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
- **Word count:** 300–600 words per indexable page.
- **Expertise signals:** Evidence-based statements, real-world mapping, and technical precision.
- **Hierarchy:**
  - `H1`: Primary keyword/topic.
  - `H2`: Core sections/problem statements.
  - `H3`: Deep-dive details/rules.

## 3. WRITING POLICY
- **Deterministic tone:** Avoid "we think" or "maybe". Use "Iceberg enforces" or "The standard defines".
- **Semantic density:** Use relevant terminology from `TERMINOLOGY.md`.
- **Zero fluff:** Every sentence must provide value or context.

## 4. MULTILINGUAL EXPANSION
- Every language version must reach the minimum word count.
- Content must be adapted to the locale's technical context where necessary.
